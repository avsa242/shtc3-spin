# shtc3-spin 
------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller, ~~P2X8C4M64P/Propeller 2~~ driver object for the Sensirion SHTC3 Temperature & RH sensor.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) ~~or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P)~~. Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* I2C connection at up to 1MHz
* TBD

P1/SPIN1:
* spin-standard-library
* 1 extra core/cog for the PASM I2C driver

~~P2/SPIN2:~~
* ~~p2-spin-standard-library~~

## Compiler Compatibility

* P1/SPIN1: OpenSpin (tested with 1.00.81)
* ~~P2/SPIN2: FastSpin (tested with 4.2.6)~~ _(not implemented yet)_
* ~~BST~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~Propeller Tool~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)
* ~~PNut~~ (incompatible - no preprocessor)

## Limitations

* Very early in development - may malfunction, or outright fail to build

## TODO

- [ ] TBD
